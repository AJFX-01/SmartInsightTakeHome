# 🚀 Autobot Node.js Backend

## 📚 Overview

The **Autobot Node.js Backend** is the server-side application for managing Autobot data. Built with Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL, it handles the creation, retrieval, and real-time updates of Autobots and their associated posts and comments. This backend also includes rate limiting and scheduled tasks to manage the Autobot generation process efficiently.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Sequelize**: A promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
- **Node-Cron**: A cron-like task scheduler for Node.js.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented using `express-rate-limit` to control the number of requests to the API.

```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure that you have Node.js and MySQL installed.

```bash
cd autobot-nodejs
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your MySQL database credentials:

```plaintext
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=my_database
DB_PORT=3306

```

### 3. Run Migrations and Seeders
Initialize your database by running migrations and seeders:

```bash
npx sequelize db:create
npx sequelize db:migrate
```

### 4. Start the Server
Start the Node.js server:

```bash
node index.js
```

Your server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📬 API Endpoints

### Base URL
`http://localhost:3000`

### Endpoints

- **GET /autobots**: Retrieve a list of Autobots (limited to 10 per request).
- **GET /autobot/:id/posts**: Retrieve posts for a specific Autobot.
- **GET /post/:id/comments**: Retrieve comments for a specific post.

Each endpoint is protected by rate limiting to prevent abuse.

For detailed API documentation, including request and response examples, visit the [API Documentation](./api-docs.md).

## 🔄 Real-Time Communication

Socket.IO is used for real-time updates. The server emits the `autoboCount` event whenever the total number of Autobots changes.

### Example of Listening for Events:

```javascript
this.$socket.on('autoboCount', (count) => {
    console.log(`Autobot count: ${count}`);
});
```

## 🕒 Scheduled Tasks

Node-Cron is used to automate the generation of Autobots. Every hour, 500 unique Autobots are created, each with 10 new posts and 10 comments per post.

## 🛡️ Rate Limiting

To protect the API from overuse, rate limiting is implemented:

- Maximum of 5 requests per minute per IP address.
- Custom error message when the rate limit is exceeded.
